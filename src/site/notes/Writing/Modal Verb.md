> Sor I didn't do a lot Q

## Question
- Can I use: Can have done?
	- No! only Could have done
	- also for will, shall

- in page 67(ebook), it shows that I can use "couldn't have" instead of "can't have"
	- the same :D

- Difference between: "What can we do about this?" & "What could we do about this?"
	- Could is more formal

## Note
- shall is very very form, a little bit too much
- could
	- 用以請求他人
